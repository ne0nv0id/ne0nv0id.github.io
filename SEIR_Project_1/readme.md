Welcome to my first Project for GA SEI!

Objectives:
1. Use ajax calls to pull data from any API. I'm using SWAPI (star wars database)
2. Create a web application that intuitively and intelligently displays the API data
3. Make the web-app responsive first to a mobile layot and a desktop one (i.e. 600px max width)

My project:
1. Using SWAPI, pulling down data from each of my 5 favorite characters
2. Sourcing images and properly sizing them in CSS for each character
3. Easter eggs!
    a. After the initial web app is done and I've moved onto styling, trying to add in sound files for each character's theme song
    b. If I can't figure out the sound files/site memory functionality in time, adding a youtube link at the bottom of each character's page to a funny clip of them
    c. If I get all of that done ahead of schedule:
        i. Insert clues to a secret character's location
        ii. Give the "secret" character a secret button on the page
