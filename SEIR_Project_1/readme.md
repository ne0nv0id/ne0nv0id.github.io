Welcome to my first Project for GA SEI!

Objectives:
1. Use ajax calls to pull data from any API. I'm using SWAPI (star wars database)
2. Create a web application that intuitively and intelligently displays the API data
3. Make the web-app responsive first to a mobile layout and a desktop one (i.e. 600px max width).

My project:
1. Using SWAPI, pulling down data from each of my 5 favorite characters
2. Sourcing images and sizing them in CSS for each character
3. Each button pulls up its own character page, and hides the other character pages.
4. On page load, the site will automaticaly display the "About" card so users aren't met with a blank landing page.
3. Easter eggs! Each character's picture links to something fun.
